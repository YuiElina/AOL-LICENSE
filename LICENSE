 * Authentic Open License (AOL).
 *
 * Personal use and limited sharing (under 25 people) is permitted

================================================================================
PREAMBLE
================================================================================

The Authentic Open License (AOL) promotes free and open software while 
preserving authorship, respecting copyright holder consent, and rejecting 
license overreach.

This license recognizes that:
1. Small-scale private sharing is common and difficult to enforce
2. Each copyright holder controls only their own work
3. Dependencies and external libraries retain their own licenses
4. No license can override consent of separate copyright holders

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- File-level licensing: AOL applies only to files explicitly licensed under AOL
- Consent-based: Only copyright holders can change license terms
- No infection: External dependencies don't override AOL files
- Relicensing permitted: Substantial modifications may be relicensed (with 
  conditions)

By using, modifying, or distributing this Software, you accept these terms.

================================================================================
1. DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

SOFTWARE: The source code, object code, binaries, documentation, and associated 
files explicitly licensed under AOL.

AOL-LICENSED FILES: Files containing an AOL license header or explicitly listed 
as AOL-licensed in project documentation.

YOU / LICENSEE: Any individual or entity exercising rights under this license.

DERIVATIVE WORK: Any work based on, derived from, or incorporating 
AOL-Licensed Files.

DEPENDENCY: External libraries, packages, or modules used by the Software but 
maintained as separate works with their own licenses.

LIGHTLY MODIFIED: Changes limited to cosmetic or non-functional edits (see 
Section 4).

SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED: Changes that materially alter functionality, control 
flow, algorithms, or data structures (see Section 4).

PERSONAL USE: Use on your own devices without sharing with others.

LIMITED SHARING: Distribution to fewer than 25 individuals via private channels:
- Direct messages or private chat
- Private repositories with explicit access control
- Closed team environments
- Private file sharing services

PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION: Any distribution that:
- Is posted to public repositories or websites
- Is published to package registries
- Is shared via social media or public forums
- Exceeds 25 recipients
- Involves commercial use or deployment
- Is otherwise made available for unrestricted access

COMMERCIAL USE: Use where revenue is derived from the Software's use, 
distribution, or deployment.

================================================================================
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
================================================================================

Subject to compliance with this license, you are granted a worldwide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to:
- Use the Software
- Copy the Software
- Modify AOL-Licensed Files
- Create Derivative Works
- Distribute the Software and Derivative Works
- Sublicense Derivative Works (subject to Section 5)

These rights apply to Personal Use, Limited Sharing, and Public Distribution, 
with different compliance requirements as specified.

================================================================================
3. SCOPE OF COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

3.1 PERSONAL USE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may use and modify AOL-Licensed Files privately without attribution, 
licensing, or compliance obligations.

3.2 LIMITED SHARING (Under 25 People, Private)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may share AOL-Licensed Files or Derivative Works with fewer than 25 
individuals via private channels without attribution or license compliance 
requirements, provided:

1. Distribution remains private (not publicly accessible)
2. Use is non-commercial
3. Recipients are explicitly identified or access is controlled

No attribution or license headers are required for Limited Sharing.

The authors acknowledge that enforcement of Limited Sharing violations is 
impractical and will not pursue legal action against individuals engaged in 
small-scale, non-commercial private sharing.

3.3 PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public Distribution of AOL-Licensed Files requires:

1. Attribution for unmodified or Lightly Modified files (Section 4.3)
2. License preservation - AOL-Licensed Files must maintain AOL license
3. Copyleft for AOL files - Derivative Works of AOL-Licensed Files must be AOL 
   (unless Substantially Modified - see Section 5)
4. Source availability - Source code must be available if binaries are 
   distributed

Dependencies and non-AOL files are NOT subject to AOL requirements (see 
Section 13).

================================================================================
4. LIGHT VS SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED WORKS
================================================================================

4.1 LIGHTLY MODIFIED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A modification is Lightly Modified if it affects only cosmetic, non-functional, 
or trivial elements:

EXAMPLES:
- Renaming functions, variables, classes, or files
- Adjusting formatting, indentation, whitespace
- Modifying or adding comments
- Reorganizing code without altering control flow
- Adding wrapper functions that call existing logic unchanged
- Translating variable/function names
- Syntax changes that don't alter behavior (e.g., if/else to ternary)
- Performance optimizations that don't change output

Refactoring without behavior change is Lightly Modified.

4.2 SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A modification is Substantially Modified if it:

LOGIC CHANGES:
- Alters, rewrites, or extends functional logic
- Changes control flow (loops, conditionals, error handling)
- Modifies algorithms affecting behavior or output
- Changes data structures affecting module behavior

SCOPE CHANGES:
- Adds new modules, classes, or files
- Rewrites more than 30% of lines in an existing file beyond Lightly Modified changes (see Section 4.1)
- Adds new functions to an existing module beyond trivial or cosmetic changes (see Section 4.1)
- Integrates with new dependencies that materially change functionality or behavior

EDGE CASES:
- One-line bug fixes: Lightly Modified
- Multiple edits, whether small or large, that together materially change functionality or behavior: Substantially Modified
- Complete rewrite in a different language: Substantially Modified


4.3 ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHTLY MODIFIED AOL FILES:

Attribution must include:

FILE HEADER:
/*
 * Based on [Original Project] by [Original Author(s)]
 * Licensed under Authentic Open License (AOL)
 * Original source: [URL if available]
 * 
 * Modified by [Your Name] on [Date]
 */

README SECTION:
## Attribution
This project includes code from [Original Project] by [Author(s)],
licensed under AOL.

Original source: [URL]
Modifications: [Brief description]

MINIMUM: File headers for modified files OR prominent README section.

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED WORKS:

Attribution is optional (see Section 5 for relicensing rights).

================================================================================
5. RELICENSING RIGHTS FOR SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATIONS
================================================================================

5.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AOL-Licensed Files must remain under AOL, except when Substantially Modified 
as defined below.

5.2 WHEN RELICENSING IS PERMITTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You MAY relicense Substantially Modified works to a different license IF all of the following conditions are met:

CONDITION 1: Heavy Modification Threshold
The work contains modifications that are substantive and meaningful according to Section 4.1. Substantive modifications must:

- Alter or improve core algorithms, logic, or control flow
- Add or restructure functionality that materially changes behavior
- Change architecture or design patterns in a way that impacts the file’s operation
- Integrate with new systems or dependencies that affect functionality

Trivial changes, cosmetic edits, or unused code additions do not count, regardless of file size.

CONDITION 2: Copyright Holder Consent
For files with multiple contributors:

- You must own copyright to your modifications
- Relicensing is allowed only if:
  - You obtain consent from all original contributors, OR
  - Your modifications represent a substantial portion of the file’s functional content, OR
  - Original content is negligible (less than 10% of functional content)

CONDITION 3: Attribution Preserved
Even when relicensing, you must preserve attribution:

/*
 * Portions originally from [Original Project] by [Author(s)]
 * Original license: Authentic Open License (AOL)
 * Substantially modified by [Your Name]
 * Current license: [New License]
*/

5.3 WHEN RELICENSING IS NOT PERMITTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may NOT relicense if:

- Modifications are Lightly Modified (cosmetic or trivial)
- Original authors explicitly prohibited relicensing in file headers
- Changes do not meet the Heavy Modification Threshold
- You lack consent from co-contributors where required

5.4 NEW FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New files you create (not derived from AOL-Licensed Files) may use any license you choose.

================================================================================
6. STRONG COPYLEFT FOR AOL FILES
================================================================================

6.1 COPYLEFT REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AOL-Licensed Files that are unmodified or Lightly Modified must remain under 
AOL when publicly distributed.

PROHIBITED:
- Removing AOL license headers from AOL files
- Relicensing AOL files under MIT, Apache, BSD, GPL, or proprietary licenses 
  (unless Section 5 applies)
- Distributing AOL files without source code availability

6.2 COPYLEFT DOES NOT APPLY TO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dependencies (npm packages, system libraries, etc.)
- New files you create
- Substantially Modified files (if relicensing conditions are met)
- Configuration files or build scripts

================================================================================
7. PROHIBITED USES
================================================================================

The Software may not be used:
- For unlawful purposes under applicable law
- To circumvent license terms in Public Distribution
- In violation of export control or sanctions laws

Personal Use and Limited Sharing violations will not be actively enforced.

================================================================================
8. PATENT GRANT
================================================================================

Each contributor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual 
patent license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Software and Derivative Works, to the extent the contributor has 
patent claims covering the Software.

8.1 PATENT LICENSE TERMINATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your patent license terminates automatically if you:
1. File patent infringement litigation claiming the Software infringes your 
   patent
2. Send written threats of such litigation

8.2 SCOPE OF TERMINATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Termination:
- Affects only you (the litigant)
- Does not affect downstream recipients
- Does not affect your right to Personal Use

================================================================================
9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
================================================================================

The Software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or 
implied, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

This includes warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
title, and non-infringement.

JURISDICTIONAL NOTE: Some jurisdictions do not allow complete exclusion of 
implied warranties. In such cases, this disclaimer is limited to the maximum 
extent permitted by law.

================================================================================
10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
================================================================================

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors are not 
liable for:
- Direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
- Loss of profits, data, or business opportunities
- Any claims arising from use, modification, or distribution

This limitation applies even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

================================================================================
11. TERMINATION
================================================================================

11.1 AUTOMATIC TERMINATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your rights terminate automatically if you violate this license in Public 
Distribution context, including:
- Removing AOL license headers from AOL files
- Failing to comply with attribution requirements
- Relicensing without meeting Section 5 conditions

11.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon termination:
- You must cease all Public Distribution
- Personal Use rights continue
- Limited Sharing rights continue (if violation was only Public 
  Distribution-related)
- Compliant copies you distributed remain valid
- Downstream recipients' rights are unaffected

11.3 REINSTATEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rights may be reinstated if you:
1. Cure the violation within 30 days of notice
2. Provide written confirmation of compliance

================================================================================
12. GOVERNING LAW
================================================================================

12.1 JURISDICTION NEUTRALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This license does not specify a governing law jurisdiction. It shall be 
interpreted according to:

1. The copyright laws of the jurisdiction where enforcement is sought
2. International copyright treaties (Berne Convention, WIPO Treaties)
3. Applicable regional directives (EU Copyright Directive, etc.)

12.2 SEVERABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If any provision of this license is held invalid or unenforceable in a 
particular jurisdiction:
- The remaining provisions remain in full effect
- The invalid provision shall be interpreted to achieve its intent to the 
  maximum extent permitted by law
- The license as a whole remains valid

12.3 INTERNATIONAL COMPATIBILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This license is designed to be compatible with copyright principles recognized 
internationally, including:
- Exclusive rights of copyright holders
- Requirements for consent in license changes
- Recognition of separate works with separate licenses
- Fair use and fair dealing doctrines (where applicable)

No specific jurisdiction is favored. This license respects the copyright laws 
of all jurisdictions while maintaining its core principles regarding copyright 
holder consent and license boundaries.

================================================================================
13. LICENSE COMPATIBILITY AND DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

13.1 CORE PRINCIPLE: FILE-LEVEL LICENSING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AOL applies ONLY to AOL-Licensed Files.

The license does NOT extend to:
- Dependencies (external packages/libraries)
- System libraries
- Build tools
- Configuration files
- Files explicitly licensed under other licenses

13.2 DEPENDENCIES AND EXTERNAL CODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When AOL-Licensed Files use dependencies (npm packages, system libraries, GPL
libraries, etc.):

EFFECT ON AOL FILES:
- AOL-Licensed Files remain under AOL
- Dependencies do NOT "infect" or override AOL files
- Each work retains its original license

EFFECT ON DEPENDENCIES:
- Dependencies retain their original licenses
- You must comply with dependency license terms
- Dependency licenses do NOT control AOL files

LEGAL BASIS:
- Copyright applies only to copyrighted work
- Dependencies are separate works with separate copyrights
- No license can override copyright holder consent
- Merely using/linking does not create derivative works

13.3 GPL INCOMPATIBILITY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AOL is incompatible with licenses that claim to extend their terms to entire
projects, including:
- GNU General Public License (GPL v2, GPL v3)
- GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)

POSITION:
Each file retains its original license. AOL-Licensed Files remain under AOL
regardless of what dependencies are used. GPL files remain GPL. Neither
license overrides the other.

AOL copyright holders have not consented to license conversion of AOL files
under any circumstances.

STRONG RECOMMENDATION:
Avoid GPL-licensed dependencies in AOL projects. While each file technically
retains its own license, the conflicting requirements create legal uncertainty
and distribution difficulties.

RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:
Instead of GPL libraries, use:
- MIT License
- BSD Licenses
- Apache License 2.0
- ISC License
- Mozilla Public License 2.0

These licenses are compatible with AOL and avoid legal conflicts.

IF YOU MUST USE GPL CODE:
- Understand that distribution may be legally problematic
- Each file keeps its own license (no conversion)
- You must comply with both licenses for their respective files
- If compliance with both is impossible, distribution is prohibited
- Seek legal counsel before distributing combined works

13.4 COMPATIBLE LICENSES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AOL works well with permissive licenses that do not claim project-wide scope:

COMPATIBLE:
- MIT License
- BSD Licenses (2-Clause, 3-Clause)
- Apache License 2.0
- ISC License
- Other permissive licenses

Each component retains its original license when combined.

13.5 PRACTICAL COMPATIBILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Public Distribution of combined works:
1. Each component must comply with its own license
2. Provide clear license notices for each component
3. Make source code available as required by each license
4. AOL files keep AOL headers
5. Dependencies keep their own license notices

If license requirements conflict and cannot both be satisfied, seek
alternative dependencies or do not distribute the combined work.

13.6 LEGAL DISCLAIMER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section represents the legal position of AOL copyright holders.

Users combining AOL code with code under other licenses should seek
independent legal counsel to understand their obligations and risks.

Courts have not definitively ruled on license compatibility questions in
most jurisdictions.

================================================================================
14. ACCEPTANCE
================================================================================

By using, modifying, or distributing the Software, you acknowledge that you
have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of the Authentic
Open License (AOL).
